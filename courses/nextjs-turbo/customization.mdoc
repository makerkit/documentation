Hi there! 👋 Welcome to this module on customizing your Makerkit Next.js Supabase Turbo project. In this module, **we will explore how you can customize your project and make it your own**.

Makerkit is designed to be fully customizable. To achieve this, we use environment variables: in this way, you can make customizations to your project without having to modify the source code - where possible.

Once you have your project set up, you will want to update a few things, such as:

1. **Details**: Update your project details, such as the name, description, and logo
2. **Branding**: Customize the colors, fonts, and other branding elements
3. **Settings**: You will also want to customize the settings of your project, such as the default language, or logic configuration
4. **Features**: You can also enable or disable features, such as authentication methods, notifications, etc.

In this module, we will explore how you can customize your project using environment variables and other methods.

## Makerkit's Configuration Architecture

1. **Environment variables**: Makerkit can access the vast majority of the configuration options through environment variables.
2. **Configuration**: The environment variables are passed to the configuration layer (`apps/web/config/*`) that uses [Zod](https://zod.dev) to validate the configuration. This ensures that the configuration is correct and that the application will not start if the configuration is invalid.
3. **Application Layer**: Finally, the configuration is passed to the application layer (`apps/web/src/*`) and the packages where it is used to customize the application.

## Environment variables

Environment variables are defined in the `.env` file in the root of the `apps/web` package.

1. **Shared Environment Variables**: Shared environment variables are defined in the `.env` file. These are the env variables shared between environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
2. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables for a specific environment are defined in the `.env.development` and `.env.production` files. These are the env variables specific to the development and production environments.
3. **Secret Keys**: Secret keys and sensitive information are not stored in the `.env` file. Instead, they are stored in the environment variables of the CI/CD system.
4. **Secret keys to be used locally**: If you need to use secret keys locally, you can store them in the `.env.local` file. This file is not committed to Git, therefore it is safe to store sensitive information in it. Don't change the ignore rule in the `.gitignore` file.

I'll reiterate for those in the back: **Do not store secret keys in the `.env` file**. Instead, store them in the environment variables of the CI/CD system.

#### Public and Private Environment Variables in Next.js

If you are new to Next.js - you need to know about public and private environment variables:

1. **Public environment variables** are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and can be accessed on the client-side. These are exposed to the browser, therefore should not be used for sensitive information.
2. **Private environment variables** can only be accessed on the server-side. These are not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

```bash {% title="apps/web/.env" %}
# Public environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME="Makerdesk"

# Private environment variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=********
```

**Always carefully consider when a variable should be made public** - and when it should be kept private. If you're not sure, it's best to keep it private.

### How do I decide where to store my environment variables?

Here's a general rule of thumb for storing environment variables:

1. **Shared and Public**: If the environment variable is shared between environments and is not sensitive, store it in the `.env` file. Things like the product name, colors, language, etc.Configuration
2. **Environment-specific and Public**: If the environment variable is specific to an environment (e.g., development, production), store it in the `.env.development` or `.env.production` file. Things like the API URL, analytics keys, etc.
3.  **Secret and Sensitive**: If the environment variable is secret and sensitive, store it in the environment variables of the CI/CD system. Things like the database URL, secret keys, etc. Locally, store them in the `.env.local` file.

**NB**: This is not Makerkit-specific. This is a general best practice for managing environment variables in a project, and it's a good practice to follow.

## Configuration Files

The configuration files are located in the `apps/web/config` directory. The configuration files are written in TypeScript and use the Zod library to validate the configuration.

Makerkit defines the following configuration files:

1. `app.config.ts`: This file stores the overall variables for your application. This includes the product name, site title, description, URL, locale, theme, etc.
2. `auth.config.ts`: This file stores the authentication configuration for your application. This includes the captcha token site key, providers (password, magic link, oAuth), etc.
3. `feature-flags.config.ts`: This file stores the feature flags configuration for your application. This includes the feature flags (enableThemeToggle, enableAccountDeletion, enableTeamDeletion, etc.), language priority, etc.
4. `billing.config.ts`: This file stores the billing schema for your application.
5. `paths.config.ts`: This file stores the paths configuration for your application
6. `personal-account-navigation.config.ts`: This file stores the global navigation configuration for the personal account's layout
7. `team-account-navigation.config.ts`: This file stores the global navigation configuration for the team account's layout

### Using Zod to validate the configuration

As mentioned, we use Zod to validate the configuration.

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It's used to validate the configuration and ensure that it's correct. To avoid shipping invalid configuration, Makerkit goes out of its way to make sure you're setting a valid configuration.

Makerkit tries its best to be __an absolute pain in the neck__ when it comes to invalid configurations. It will throw an error if the configuration is invalid, and the application will not start.

I know you will curse my name while seeing red builds all over your CI - but this is for your own good. Trust me - an invalid configuration can lead to a lot of headaches down the road - and I don't want that for you.

{% img src="/assets/courses/next-turbo/env-variables-architecture-zod.webp" width="674" height="362" /%}

Let's take a quick look at how `app.config.ts` is structured. First, we define the schema using Zod:

```tsx
const AppConfigSchema = z
  .object({
    name: z
      .string({
        description: `This is the name of your SaaS. Ex. "Makerkit"`,
        required_error: `Please provide the variable NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME`,
      })
      .min(1),
    title: z
      .string({
        description: `This is the default title tag of your SaaS.`,
        required_error: `Please provide the variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TITLE`,
      })
      .min(1),
    description: z.string({
      description: `This is the default description of your SaaS.`,
      required_error: `Please provide the variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION`,
    }),
    url: z
      .string({
        required_error: `Please provide the variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`,
      })
      .url({
        message: `You are deploying a production build but have entered a NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL variable using http instead of https. It is very likely that you have set the incorrect URL. The build will now fail to prevent you from from deploying a faulty configuration. Please provide the variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL with a valid URL, such as: 'https://example.com'`,
      }),
    locale: z
      .string({
        description: `This is the default locale of your SaaS.`,
        required_error: `Please provide the variable NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE`,
      })
      .default('en'),
    theme: z.enum(['light', 'dark', 'system']),
    production: z.boolean(),
    themeColor: z.string(),
    themeColorDark: z.string(),
  })
  .refine(
    (schema) => {
      const isCI = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CI;

      if (isCI ?? !schema.production) {
        return true;
      }

      return !schema.url.startsWith('http:');
    },
    {
      message: `Please use a valid HTTPS URL in production.`,
      path: ['url'],
    },
  )
  .refine(
    (schema) => {
      return schema.themeColor !== schema.themeColorDark;
    },
    {
      message: `Please provide different theme colors for light and dark themes.`,
      path: ['themeColor'],
    },
  );
```

Then, we parse the configuration using the schema:

```tsx
const appConfig = AppConfigSchema.parse({
  name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME,
  title: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TITLE,
  description: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION,
  url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
  locale: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE,
  theme: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_THEME_MODE,
  themeColor: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_COLOR,
  themeColorDark: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_COLOR_DARK,
  production,
});
```

As you can see here, we use Next.js environment variables to set the configuration. Let's assume you want to set the product name and app URL. You'd update the variables in the `.env` file:

```bash {% title="apps/web/.env" %}
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME="Makerdesk"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://myapp.com
```

Now, the configuration is validated using the Zod schema - and your application can safely use `appConfig` without worrying about invalid configuration.

```tsx
import appConfig from '~/config/app.config';

const appUrl = appConfig.url;
const isProduction = appConfig.production;
```

Perfect! Now you know how to customize your Makerkit Next.js Supabase Turbo project using environment variables and configuration files.

To know the specific environment variables, [please head to the configuration's documentation](/docs/next-supabase-turbo/environment-variables).

## Customizing your project details

Okay - we have a new application, and we want to customize it. Let's start by updating the project details.

You will want to update the following details:

1. **Product Name**: This is the name of your application. It's displayed in the header, footer, and other places.
2. **Site Title**: This is the title of your application. It's displayed in the title tag of the browser.
3. **Site Description**: This is the description of your application. It's displayed in the meta description tag of the browser.
4. **Site URL**: This is the URL of your application. It's used for SEO and other purposes.
5. **Default Locale**: This is the default locale of your application. It's used for localization purposes.
6. **Theme**: This is the default theme of your application. It's used to set the theme of your application.
7. **Theme Color**: This is the color of your application. It's used to set the color of your application.

This is all done using environment variables. You can update the environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash {% title="apps/web/.env" %}
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME="Makerdesk"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TITLE="Makerdesk - Customer Support for busy creators"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION="Makerdesk is a customer support platform for creators. Receive and respond to tickets in real-time."
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://myapp.com
```

Our application will now use these environment variables to set the project details throughout the application.

## Customizing your project branding

Next, let's customize the branding of your application. You will want to update the colors, fonts, and other branding elements.

### Updating the Theme

**Makerkit uses Shadcn UI as UI library for the components**. Shadcn UI itself uses Radix UI, a Headless UI library, to build the components. Here we are simply repeating the same instructions as for the [Shadcn UI Themes documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes) for completeness.

By default, Makerkit uses the default colors of Shadcn UI using the New York style, albeit with some minor changes. However, you can customize the colors using their theme system. Please [visit the Shadcn UI Themes documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes) to learn more about how to customize the theme.

To update the colors, please pick your favorite theme from the Shadcn UI themes, copy the CSS variables, and update the global CSS style at `apps/web/styles/shadcn-ui.css`.

I personally decided to apply the `Violet` theme to this application. **I therefore copied the CSS variables from the theme and updated the global CSS style** (only for light mode, as I prefer Makerkit's default dark colors):

```css {% title="apps/web/styles/shadcn-ui.css" %}
@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: hsl(0 0% 100%);
    --foreground: hsl(224 71.4% 4.1%);

}
```

Please feel free to choose any color, or leave the default colors as they are.

### Updating the Logo

The logo is displayed in various parts of the application - and it's stored in a React component.

To update the logo, you can replace the logo in the `apps/web/components/app-logo.tsx` file:

1. **SVGs**:You can provide your own SVG
2. **Images**: You can also use an image and set the `src` attribute to the image URL
3. **Text**: You can also use a text logo and set the `children` attribute to the text

As long as the logo is placed in the `apps/web/components/app-logo.tsx` file, it will be used throughout the application - and can really be anything you want.

For my logo, I designed the following SVG in Figma:

```tsx {% title="apps/web/components/app-logo.tsx" %}
import Link from 'next/link';

import { cn } from '@kit/ui/utils';

function LogoImage({
  className,
  width = 105,
}: {
  className?: string;
  width?: number;
}) {
  return (
    <svg
      width={width}
      className={cn(`w-[95px]`, className)}
      viewBox="0 0 952 140"
      fill="none"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    >

You can replace the SVG with your own SVG. You can also use an image or text logo.

After updating both the colors and the logo, we start giving our SaaS product a new soul. It's starting to look like our own product.

{% img src="/assets/courses/next-turbo/makerdesk-logo.webp" width="1086" height="1264" /%}

### Updating the Favicons

The favicons, instead, are stored in the public folder at `apps/web/public/images/favicon`. You can replace the favicons with your own favicons.

For example, use the [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/) to generate the favicons and replace the favicons in the `apps/web/public/images/favicon` folder. Normally, it's just a matter of dropping the new files and overwrite the existing ones using the Makerkit logo.

### Updating the Fonts

Updating the fonts is well covered in [the kit's documentation](https://makerkit.dev/docs/next-supabase-turbo/fonts).

Let's update the font in our application so we can see the changes. I will replace the default font for the headings with `Quicksand`. It's extremely easy, we only need to update the import:

```tsx {% title="apps/web/lib/fonts.ts" %} {1}
import { Quicksand as HeadingFont, Inter as SansFont } from 'next/font/google';

/**
 * @sans
 * @description Define here the sans font.
 * By default, it uses the Inter font from Google Fonts.
 */
const sans = SansFont({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-sans',
  fallback: ['system-ui', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial'],
  preload: true,
  weight: ['300', '400', '500', '600', '700'],
});

/**
 * @heading
 * @description Define here the heading font.
 * By default, it uses the Urbanist font from Google Fonts.
 */
const heading = HeadingFont({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-heading',
  fallback: ['system-ui', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial'],
  preload: true,
  weight: ['500', '700'],
});

// we export these fonts into the root layout
export { sans, heading };
```

Great, the font has been updated.

NB: feel free to choose any other font (or keep the existing one). Our goal here is only to show you how to update the font should you want to.

By default, we use the `sans` font for the body text and the `heading` font for the headings.

## Home Page

Once you've updated the colors, logo, favicons, and fonts, you can update the home page to reflect your application's purpose.

I normally don't work on the home page right away, but I like to update the main heading and the subheading. So that's what we'll do now.

Since our application is a real-time customer support ticket SaaS, I tasked Claude Sonnet to write a catchy subheading for the home page. He came up with the following:

- **Main Heading**: "Customer Support for busy creators"
- **Subheading**: "Collect and manage customer support in one place. Solve customer issues faster and keep them happy."

We can now start updating our website's home page with this content.

As we've seen in the previous lesson, the marketing section lives in the `apps/web/app/(marketing)` folder. This folder uses the pathless routing feature of Next.js to render the marketing pages at the root of the project, while separating them into a different layout for UI consistency.

```tsx {% title="apps/web/app/(marketing)/page.tsx" %}
<HeroTitle>
  <span className={'text-primary'}>
    Customer Support
  </span>

  <span>
    <span>for busy creators</span>
  </span>
</HeroTitle>
```

And then we can update the subheading:

```tsx {% title="apps/web/app/(marketing)/page.tsx" %}
<div className={'flex flex-col items-center space-y-8'}>
  <HeroTitle>
    <span className={'text-primary'}>
      Customer Support
    </span>

    <span>
      <span>for busy creators</span>
    </span>
  </HeroTitle>

  <div className={'flex flex-col'}>
    <Heading
      level={2}
      className={
        'p-0 text-center font-sans text-2xl font-normal text-muted-foreground'
      }
    >
      <span>
        Collect and manage customer support in one place.
      </span>
    </Heading>

    <Heading
      level={2}
      className={
        'p-0 text-center font-sans text-2xl font-normal text-muted-foreground'
      }
    >
      <span>
        Solve customer issues faster and keep them happy.
      </span>
    </Heading>

    <Heading
      level={2}
      className={
        'p-0 text-center font-sans text-2xl font-normal text-muted-foreground'
      }
    >
      Start for free. No credit card required.
    </Heading>
  </div>

  <MainCallToActionButton />
</div>
```

{% img src="/assets/courses/next-turbo/landing-page.webp" width="2984" height="2224" /%}

Et voilà! We've updated the home page with the new content. This is enough for this module's purpose, but you can continue to update the home page with more content, such as testimonials, features, etc.

## Updating the Features Configuration

The features configuration is stored at `apps/web/config/feature-flags.config.ts`. This file contains the features of the application and their status (enabled or disabled).

```tsx {% title="apps/web/config/feature-flags.config.ts" %}

const featuresFlagConfig = FeatureFlagsSchema.parse({
  enableThemeToggle: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_THEME_TOGGLE,
    true,
  ),
  enableAccountDeletion: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_DELETION,
    false,
  ),
  enableTeamDeletion: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEAM_ACCOUNTS_DELETION,
    false,
  ),
  enableTeamAccounts: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEAM_ACCOUNTS,
    true,
  ),
  enableTeamCreation: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEAM_ACCOUNTS_CREATION,
    true,
  ),
  enablePersonalAccountBilling: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_BILLING,
    false,
  ),
  enableTeamAccountBilling: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEAM_ACCOUNTS_BILLING,
    false,
  ),
  languagePriority: process.env
    .NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGUAGE_PRIORITY as LanguagePriority,
  enableNotifications: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS,
    true,
  ),
  realtimeNotifications: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_NOTIFICATIONS,
    false,
  ),
  enableVersionUpdater: getBoolean(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_VERSION_UPDATER,
    false,
  ),
} satisfies z.infer<typeof FeatureFlagsSchema>);
```

As you can see - we do have quite a few flags that you can enable or disable. You can update the flags to reflect the features of your application.

Since our application is meant to be B2B - we can disable the personal account billing:

```tsx {% title="apps/web/.env" %}
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_BILLING="false"
```

Team Account billing is enabled by default, so we keep it as is. Please change any other flags as you see fit.

You can also add new flags to the configuration if you want to add new features to your application.

## Exploring the Application

Okay, before we wrap up, let's explore the application to see the changes we've made - and to give you an overview of the application.

### Running Supabase

To run Supabase, you need to make sure Docker is currently running on your machine.

Is Docker running? If not, start Docker.

You can now start Supabase by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:start
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode.

You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application - and you will see the changes we've made, with a new color, logo (and if you changed it) a new font.

### Logging in to the Application

You can log in to the application using the following credentials:

- **Email**: `test@makerkit.dev`
- **Password**: `testingpassword`

#### Signing up for a new account

You can also sign up for a new account if you want. If you do, make sure to navigate to [Mailpit](http://localhost:54324) to confirm your email address.

Once you've logged in, you're signed into the user dashboard at `/home`. From there, you can navigate to the User Settings, or navigate to a Team Account using the dropdown in the sidebar.

Please feel free to familiarize yourself with the application and explore the features.

## Wrapping Up

In this module, **we've updated the colors, logo, favicons, and fonts of our application**. We've also updated the home page with new content. You can continue to update the home page with more content, such as testimonials, features, etc.

We also learned **how Makerkit stores and validates the configuration using environment variables and Zod**. This is (IMHO) a great way to manage the configuration of your application, and I recommend you use it in your projects as they grow.

In the next module, we'll learn **how to develop the Database schema for our application**. We'll use Supabase to create the database schema and set up the database for our application. See you there!
