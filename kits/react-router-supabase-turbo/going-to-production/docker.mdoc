---

If you want to self-host your application, you can deploy it using Docker. 

This guide will help you deploy the React Router SaaS boilerplate to any Docker-compatible platform. For the sake of this guide, we will build and run the Docker container on a local machine.

### 0. Generate the Dockerfile

Run the following command to generate the Dockerfile:

```bash
pnpm run turbo gen docker
```

This command will generate a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of the project. In addition, it will install some dependencies that may be required to build the project, and set `output=standalone` in the `apps/web/next.config.mjs` file. If not, please do it manually.

### 1. Generate Environment Variables

Using the Dev Tools, generate the environment variables for the production environment. Place the environment variables in the `.env` file. You will then need to add them to the Docker container.

#### 2. Exclude secrets during the build time

To avoid exposing secrets during the build time, make sure to temporarily
remove the secret keys from the env file. Open the `.env` file in the
`apps/web` directory and remove the following (but keep them around for later):

```bash
CAPTCHA_SECRET_TOKEN=***
OPENAI_API_KEY=***
RESEND_API_KEY=***
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=***
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=***
SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=***
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=***
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t ghcr.io/<namespace>/<app> .
```

The above command will build the Docker image for the `linux/amd64` architecture. This is the most common architecture for Docker images, however modify the command to build for the architecture you need.

### 3. Run the Docker Container

#### 3.1. Make sure the .env file exists

First, ensure that the `.env` file is present in the `apps/web` directory.

#### 3.2 Add secret environment variables

We can now add back the environment variables containing secret values that
will only be used at runtime:

```bash
CAPTCHA_SECRET_TOKEN=***
OPENAI_API_KEY=***
RESEND_API_KEY=***
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=***
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=***
SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=***
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=***
```

#### 3.3 Run the container

Then, run the following command to run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env <app>
```

Place replace `<app>` with the name of your application. The above command will run the Docker container in detached mode (`-d`) and map port `3000` on the host to port `3000` on the container.

### 4. Access the Application

You can now access the application at `http://<your-docker-host>:3000`.

### 5. Push the Docker Image to a Container Registry

If you want to push the Docker image to a container registry, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker push <your-docker-image>
```

If you're using the Github Container Registry, you can run the following command:

1. **Create a personal access token**: Generate a personal access token from Github - so that you can login to the Container Registry.
2. **Login to the Container Registry**: Login into the Github Container Registry:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io
```

### 6. Pull the Docker Image from the Github Container Registry in your VPS

Now, you can pull the Docker image from the Github Container Registry in your VPS.

1. **Login into your VPS**: Login into your VPS using SSH or a VPS management tool.
2. **Pull the Docker image**: Pull the Docker image from the Github Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/your-username/repo
```

### 7. Run the Docker Container

Then, you can run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/your-username/repo
```

### 8. Access the Application

You can now access the application at `http://<your-docker-host>:3000`.
