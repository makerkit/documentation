## Overview of the Remix Supabase Turbo Starter Kit

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/contact.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Blog

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/blog-post.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Documentation

The documentation is where users can learn how to use the product. It includes guides, tutorials, and reference material.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/walkthrough-documentation.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Legal Pages

The legal pages are, of course, empty and need to be filled in with the appropriate legal information.

Don't use ChatGPT to fill them up. It's a bad idea.

## Authentication

The authentication system is where users can sign up, sign in, reset their password. It also includes multi-factor authentication.

### Sign Up

The sign-up page is where users can create an account. They need to provide their email address and password.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/sign-up.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

Once successful, users are asked to confirm their email address. This is enabled by default - and due to security reasons, it's not possible to disable it.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/sign-up-success.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Sign In

The sign-in page is where users can log in to their account. They need to provide their email address and password.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/sign-in.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Password Reset

The password reset page is where users can reset their password. They need to provide their email address.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/password-reset.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an additional layer of security that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to sign in to their account.

First, users need to enable MFA and add a factor:

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/setup-mfa.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

Then, after signing in, users need to provide the verification code:

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/verify-mfa.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

## Internal / Behind authentication pages

After signing in - users are redirected to the internal pages of the application. These pages are only accessible to authenticated users.

The internal part of the application is divided into two workspaces:

1. The user workspace
2. The team workspace (optional)

This is how this works:

1. **Personal Account** - all users have a personal account. This is where they can: manage their settings, choose a team account - and **optionally** subscribe to a plan, or access the features you provide.
2. **Team Account (optional)** - users can create a team account - and invite other users to join. The team account has its own workspace - where users can manage the team settings, members, and billing.

Generally speaking, **it's up to you** to decide what features are available to personal accounts and team accounts. You can choose to disable billing for personal accounts - and only enable it for team accounts - or vice versa.

One simple rule of a thumb is that personal accounts are for individuals - and team accounts are for organizations. Personal accounts cannot be disabled, as that would disallow users from accessing the application should they not be part of a team - which doesn't make sense.

## Personal Account Features

The personal account workspace is where users can access the features available to their personal account.

This is the home page after logging in - and it's the user workspace:

1. Home Page - empty by default
2. Account Settings
3. Billing (if enabled)

### Home Page of the user workspace

By default - the user home is an empty page - as it's likely you will want to place some content that is unique to your SaaS.

However, we provide a component that allows you to lists the team an account is part of: this is useful for B2B SaaS rather than B2C.

The internal pages have two layouts:

1. A sidebar layout (default)
2. A top navigation layout

You can choose any of the two - and also choose either one for the user layout or the account layout.

Below is the user home page with the sidebar layout:

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/user-home-sidebar.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

And below is the user home page with the top navigation layout:

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/user-home-header.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

You can choose the one that fits your needs.

### Account Settings of the user workspace

From the navigation - users can access their account settings. Here they can update their profile information, change their password, language, multi-factor authentication, and more.

We've used light mode so far - how about dark mode? Let's switch to dark mode:

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/user-account-settings.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Billing of the user workspace

Users can checkout and subscribe to a plan - or visit the billing portal - from the billing page. This is only visible if billing is enabled. In fact - you can
choose to disable billing for a personal account - and only enable it for team accounts - or vice versa.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/user-billing.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

Once choosing a plan - we load the embedded checkout form from Stripe (or Lemon Squeezy).

## Team Account Features

From the profile dropdown, users can choose:

1. Switch to a team account
2. Create a team account

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/user-profile-dropdown.webp" width="876" height="796" /%}

In a team account workspace - users can access the following features:

1. A team account home page: by default - we display a mock dashboard, just as an example.
2. Account settings: users can update the team account settings.
3. Members: users can view the members of the team account.
4. Billing: users can view the billing of the team account.

### Home Page of the team workspace

By default - the team home is a mock dashboard - just as an example. You can replace this with your own dashboard - or any other content.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/team-account-dashboard.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Account Settings of the team workspace

From the navigation - users can access the team account settings. Here they can update the team account information, or delete the team account (if owner), or leave the team account (if member).

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/team-account-settings.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Members page of the team workspace

From the navigation - users can access the members of the team account.

Here they can:

1. view the members
2. invite new members
3. remove or update an existing member
4. transfer ownership to another member
5. remove or update an invitation

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/team-account-members.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Billing of the team workspace

If enabled - users can view the billing of the team account - and subscribe to a plan or visit the billing portal.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/team-account-billing.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

## Joining a team account

When a user is invited to join a team account - they receive an email with an invitation link. After signing up or signing in - they are redirected to the join page.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/sign-up-invite.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Join Page

The join page is where users can join a team account.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/join-team.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

## Super Admin

The super admin is the administrator of the SaaS. They have access to a special set of features that allow them to manage the accounts of the SaaS.

### Home Page of the super admin

The home page is a small overview of the SaaS. You can easily customize this page to show the most important metrics of your SaaS.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/super-admin-dashboard.jpg" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Listing the accounts of the SaaS

The super admin can view all the accounts of the SaaS. They can filter the accounts by personal accounts, team accounts, or all accounts.

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/super-admin-accounts.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}

### Viewing the account details

The super admin can view the details of an account. They can see the account information, the members of the account, and the billing information.

Additionally, they can perform the following actions:

1. Ban the account (or unban)
2. Delete the account

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/walkthrough/super-admin-account.webp" width="3420" height="2142" /%}
