The [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) provider in Remix Supabase Turbo is a simple way to integrate Google Analytics into your Next.js application using the Makerkit's Analytics package.

## Installation

First, you need to pull the `@kit/analytics` package into your project using the CLI

```bash
npx @makerkit/cli@latest plugins install
```

When prompted, select the `Google Analytics` package from the list of available packages. Once the command completes, you should see the `packages/plugins/google-analytics` directory in your project.

You can now import this package into your project:

```bash
pnpm add "@kit/google-analytics@workspace:*" --filter "@kit/analytics" -D
```

You can now use the Google Analytics plugin in the Analytics package. Update the `packages/analytics/src/index.ts` file as follows:

```tsx title="packages/analytics/src/index.ts"
import { createGoogleAnalyticsService } from '@kit/google-analytics';

import { createAnalyticsManager } from './analytics-manager';
import type { AnalyticsManager } from './types';

export const analytics: AnalyticsManager = createAnalyticsManager({
    providers: {
        'google-analytics': createGoogleAnalyticsService,
    },
});
```

## Configuration

Please add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

This is the Measurement ID of your Google Analytics property. You can find it in the Google Analytics dashboard.

Additionally, you can add the following environment variable to your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_GA_DISABLE_PAGE_VIEWS_TRACKING=true
VITE_GA_DISABLE_LOCALHOST_TRACKING=true
```
