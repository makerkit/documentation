After creating your migration, it's time to add the required code.

In our example, we create the schema for a simple tasks application.

### Permissions

Makerkit defines a set of default permissions in an enum named `public.app_permissions`.

To add more permissions for your app, please update the enum:

```sql
-- insert new permissions
alter type public.app_permissions add value 'tasks.write';
alter type public.app_permissions add value 'tasks.delete';
commit;
```

In the case above, we added the permissions `tasks.write` and `tasks.delete`. We can use these in our RLS rules to make sure
the permissions are able to restrict access.

### Tasks Table

Let's now add the new `tasks` table

```sql
-- create tasks table
create table if not exists public.tasks (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  title varchar(500) not null,
  description varchar(50000),
  done boolean not null default false,
  account_id uuid not null references public.accounts(id),
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone not null default now()
);

grant select, insert, update, delete on table public.tasks to
    authenticated, service_role;
```

Let's explain:
- 1. `uuid` is a primary key generated automatically
- 2. `title` is a text field constrained to 500 chars. `not null` makes sure it cannot be null.
- 3. `description` is a text field constrained to 50000
- 4. `done` is a boolean field
- 5. `account_id` is the account that owns the task

We then add the required permissions to the roles `authenticated` and `service_role`.

Anonymous users have no access to this table.

### Accounts

Accounts are the primary entities of our schema. An account can be a user or a team.

We can connect an entity to the account that owns it using a foreign key

```sql
account_id uuid not null references public.accounts(id)
```

### Enabling RLS

When you create a new table, always enable RLS.

```sql
-- enable row level security
alter table tasks enable row level security;
```

### RLS Policies

RLS Policies are fundamental to protect our tables.

We insert an RLS policy for each action: `select`, `insert`, `update` and `delete`.

#### Selecting Tasks

When writing an RLS policy for selecting data from the `tasks` table, we need to make sure the user is the owner of the task or has the required permission.

Generally speaking, entities belong to `public.accounts` - and we can use the `account_id` to check if the user is the owner.

```sql
create policy select_tasks on public.tasks
    for select
    to authenticated
    using (
      account_id = auth.uid() or
      public.has_role_on_account(account_id)
    );
```

Did you know that an account can be a user or a team? We can use the `public.has_role_on_account` function to check if the user has a role on the account.

Therefore, this RLS policy works in both ways:

1. if the user is the owner of the task - we check that the `account_id` is equal to the `auth.uid()`
2. if the user has a role on the account - we check that the user has a role on the account

#### Inserting Tasks

When writing an RLS policy for inserting data into the `tasks` table, we need to make sure the user is the owner of the task or has the required permission.

```sql
create policy insert_tasks on public.tasks
    for insert
    with check (
        account_id = auth.uid() or
        public.has_permission(auth.uid(), account_id, 'tasks.write'::app_permissions)
    );
```

In th above, we check if the user is the owner of the task or has the `tasks.write` permission.

1. If the `account_id` is equal to the `auth.uid()` - the account is personal - so permissions are not required
2. If the user has the `tasks.write` permission - the user can insert the task

### Updating Tasks

When writing an RLS policy for updating data in the `tasks` table, we need to make sure the user is the owner of the task or has the required permission.

```sql
create policy update_tasks on public.tasks
    for update
    using (
        account_id = auth.uid() or
        public.has_permission(auth.uid(), account_id, 'tasks.write'::app_permissions)
    )
    with check (
        account_id = auth.uid() or
        public.has_permission(auth.uid(), account_id, 'tasks.write'::app_permissions)
    );
```

Did you know that we need to add the `using` and `with check` clauses?

- `using` is used to filter the rows that the user can update
- `with check` is used to check if the user can update the row

In the above, we check if the user is the owner of the task or has the `tasks.write` permission.

### Deleting Tasks

When writing an RLS policy for deleting data from the `tasks` table, we need to make sure the user is the owner of the task or has the required permission.

```sql
create policy delete_tasks on public.tasks
    for delete
    using (
        account_id = auth.uid() or
        public.has_permission(auth.uid(), account_id, 'tasks.delete'::app_permissions)
    );
```

In the above, we check if the user is the owner of the task or has the `tasks.delete` permission.

Our schema is now complete! Yay! 🎉

### Resetting Migrations

When adding a new schema, we need to reset the migrations.

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:reset
```

Then, we generate the new types using the following command:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:typegen
```

You can now use the new types in your application when using the Supabase client.
