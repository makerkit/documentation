The Next.js Supabase Turbo Dev Tools allows you to debug environment variables using contextual information and error messages.

## Getting Started with the Dev Tool

If you run the `pnpm run dev` command, you will see the Dev Tools at `http://localhost:3010/variables`.

You can choose two different modes:

1. **Development Mode**: This mode is used when you run the `pnpm run dev` command
2. **Production Mode**: This mode is used when you run the `pnpm run build` command

### Development Mode

In the Development Mode, the Dev Tools will show you the environment variables used during development. This is useful when you are developing your application and want to see the environment variables that are used in your application.

This mode will use the variables from the following files:

1. `.env`
2. `.env.development`
3. `.env.local`

### Production Mode

In the Production Mode, the Dev Tools will show you the environment variables used during production. This is useful when you are deploying your application and want to see the environment variables that are used in your application.

This mode will use the variables from the following files:

1. `.env`
2. `.env.production`
3. `.env.local`
4. `.env.production.local`

### Contextual Validation

Thanks to contextual validation, we can validate environment variables based
on the value of other environment variables. For example, if you have a variable
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_PROVIDER` with the value `stripe`, we can validate that
all the variables required for Stripe are set.

## Using the Dev Tool to Debug Environment Variables

The Dev tool shows at a glance the current state of your environment variables. It also shows you the errors that might occur when using the environment variables.

1. **Valid**: This shows you the valid values for the environment variable. Bear in mind, the fact a value is valid does not mean it is correct. It only means that the data-type is correct for the variable.
2. **Invalid**: This shows you the errors that might occur when using the environment variable. For example, if you try to use an invalid data-type, the Dev Tool will show you an error message. It will also warn when a variable is required but not set.
3. **Overridden**: This shows you if the environment variable is overridden. If the variable is overridden, the Dev Tool will show you the value that is being used.

Use the filters to narrow down the variables you want to debug.

### Debugging Production Environment Variables

Of course, most of your production environment variables will be set in your hosting provider for security reasons. To temporarily debug your production environment variables, you can use the following steps:

1. Copy the variables from your hosting provider
2. Create a file at `apps/web/.env.production.local`. This file will be ignored by Git.
3. Paste the copied variables into the `apps/web/.env.production.local` file.
4. Use `Production` as the mode in the Dev Tool.
5. Analyze the data in the Dev Tool.

NB: Delete the `apps/web/.env.production.local` file when you're done or store it securely.

## Adding your own Environment Variables

During your development workflow, you may need to add new environment
variables. So that you can debug your application, you can add your own
environment variables to the Dev Tool.

Let's assume you want to add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY=value
```

To add these variables, you need to create a new file in the `apps/dev-tool/app/variables/lib/env-variables-model.ts` file.

The file should look like this:

```tsx {% title="apps/dev-tool/app/variables/lib/env-variables-model.ts" %}
[
  {
    name: 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED',
    description: 'Enables analytics',
    category: 'Analytics',
    validate: ({ value }) => {
      return z
        .coerce
        .boolean()
        .optional()
        .safeParse(value);
    },
  },
  {
  name: 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY',
  description: 'API Key for the analytics service',
  category: 'Analytics',
  contextualValidation: {
    dependencies: [{
      variable: 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED',
      condition: (value) => {
        return value === 'true';
      },
      message:
        'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY is required when NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED is set to "true"',
    }],
    validate: ({ value }) => {
     return z
        .string()
        .min(1, 'An API key is required when analytics is enabled')
        .safeParse(value);
    }
  }
}]
```

In the above, we added two new environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY`.

We also added a validation function for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY` variable. This function checks if the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` variable is set to `true`. If it is, the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY` variable becomes required. If it is not, the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_KEY` variable is optional.

In this way, you can make sure that your environment variables are valid and meet the requirements of your application.
