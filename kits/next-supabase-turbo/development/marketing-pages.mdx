Makerkit comes with pre-defined marketing pages to help you get started with your SaaS application. These pages are built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and are located in the `apps/web/app/(marketing)` directory.

Makerkit comes with the following marketing pages:

- Home Page
- Contact Form
- Pricing Page
- FAQ
- Contact Page (with a contact form)

## Adding a new marketing page

To add a new marketing page to your Makerkit application, you need to follow these steps.

Create a folder in the `apps/web/app/(marketing)` directory with the path you want to use for the page. For example, to create a new page at `/about`, you would create a folder named `about`. Then, create the page file in the folder. For example, to create an `about` page, you would create an `page.tsx` file in the `about` folder.

```tsx
// apps/web/app/(marketing)/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return <div></div>
}
```

This page inherits the layout at `apps/web/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`. You can customize the layout by editing this file - but remember that it will affect all marketing pages.

## Contact Form

To make the contact form work, you need to add the following environment variables:

```bash
CONTACT_EMAIL=
```

In this variable, you need to set the email address where you want to receive the contact form submissions. The sender will be the same as the one configured in your [mailing configuration](email-configuration).
