Many teams prefer to create an external marketing website for their SaaS application. This allows them to have more control over the design and content of the website. For example, using services such as Framer, Webflow, or Wordpress.

In this case, we have to redirect all marketing pages to the external marketing website. You can do so tweaking the middleware in the `apps/web/middleware.ts` file.

Take the list of all your marketing pages, and then add a middleware to redirect all those pages to the external marketing website.

```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  if (isMarketingPage(req)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('https://your-external-website.com' + req.nextUrl.pathname);
  }

  // leave the rest of the middleware unchanged
}

function isMarketingPage(req: NextRequest) {
  const marketingPages = [
    '/pricing',
    '/faq',
    '/contact',
    '/about',
    '/home',
    '/privacy-policy',
    '/terms-and-conditions',
    '/cookie-policy',
  ];

  return marketingPages.includes(req.nextUrl.pathname);
}
```

Should you add a new marketing page, you need to update the `isMarketingPage` function with the new page path.

## Using Next.js Rewrites

You can use Next.js rewrite functionality to seamlessly redirect to an external marketing website without changing the visible URL. 

Here's a sample configuration for setting up Next.js rewrites:

```js
rewrites: async () => {
  return {
    beforeFiles: [
      // These rewrites are checked after headers/redirects
      // and before all files including _next/public files which
      // allows overriding page files
      {
        source: '/pricing',
        destination: 'https://your-external-website.com/pricing',
      },
    ],
  };
};
```

To implement this, add the rewrite configuration to your `next.config.js` file. This setup allows you to redirect to your external marketing site's homepage without altering the URL path seen by users.

When deciding between using middleware or the rewrite functionality, consider the specific requirements of your application. The middleware method is useful when you need to conditionally redirect specific pages, while the rewrite method is more suited for overriding entire paths seamlessly.

### Additional Considerations

While using URL rewrites, ensure that it aligns with your SEO and analytics strategies, as the visible URL remains unchanged. Keep a clear list of routes affected by these integrations to ease updates and management.
