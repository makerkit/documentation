Makerkit projects store translations at the application level, specifically in the `apps/web/public/locales` directory. By default, English translations are provided and can be found at `apps/web/public/locales/en`.

If you're looking to expand your application's language support, follow these two steps:

## 1. Create Language Files

First, create a new folder in `apps/web/public/locales/[lng]`, where `[lng]` represents the appropriate language code. This could be `de` for German, `it` for Italian, `es` for Spanish, `ja` for Japanese, and so on.

## 2. Update Language Settings

Next, add the new language to the settings file located at `apps/web/lib/i18n/i18n.settings.ts`:

```tsx
/**
 * The list of supported languages.
 * By default, only the default language is supported.
 * Add more languages here if needed.
 */
export const languages: string[] = [defaultLanguage, 'es'];
```

In the example above, the language `es` (Spanish) is added to the `languages` array. Feel free to add as many languages as your application requires.

## 3. Add new namespaces

If you want to add a new namespace (for example, `chatbots.json`) where you will store translations for chatbots, you can do so by creating a new file in the `apps/web/public/locales/[lng]` directory. For example, `apps/web/public/locales/en/chatbots.json`.

Then, you register the new namespace in the `i18n.settings.ts` file:

```tsx {8} title="apps/web/lib/i18n/i18n.settings.ts"
export const defaultI18nNamespaces = [
  'common',
  'auth',
  'account',
  'teams',
  'billing',
  'marketing',
  'chatbots',
];
```

In the example above, the `chatbots` namespace is added to the `defaultI18nNamespaces` array. And that's it! You can now start adding translations to your new namespace.
