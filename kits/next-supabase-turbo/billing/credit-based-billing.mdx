Credit-based billing is a billing model where you charge your users based on the number of credits they consume. This model is useful when you want to charge your users based on the number of actions they perform in your application.

As you may know, this is extremely popular for AI SaaS products, where users may have a limited amount of tokens (or credits) to perform actions - such as requesting data from an LLM.

Makerkit doesn't have a built-in credit-based billing system, but you can easily implement it using the existing billing system.

To do so, we can introduce two new tables to our database: `plans` and `credits`. The `plans` table will store the pricing information for each plan, and the `credits` table will store the credits consumed by each user.

Here's how you can set it up:

### Step 1: Create the `plans` table

First we need to create a `plans` table to store the pricing information for each plan.

```sql
create table public.plans (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  variant_id text not null
);

alter table public.plans enable row level security;

-- allow authenticated users to read plans
create policy read_plans
  on public.plans
  for select
  to authenticated
  using (true);
```

We've created a `plans` table with two columns: `name` and `variant_id`. The `name` column stores the name of the plan, and the `variant_id` column stores the ID of the plan variant.

We also enabled row-level security on the `plans` table and created a policy that allows authenticated users to read the plans.

### Step 2: Create the `credits` table

Next, we need to create a `credits` table to store the credits consumed by each user.

```sql
create table public.credits (
  account_id uuid not null references public.accounts(id),
  tokens integer not null
);

alter table public.credits enable row level security;

-- allow authenticated users to read their credits
create policy read_credits
  on public.credits
  for select
  to authenticated
  using (
    account_id = (select auth.uid())
  );
```

In the above SQL, we create two tables: `plans` and `credits`. The `plans` table stores the pricing information for each plan, and the `credits` table stores the credits consumed by each user.

We also enabled row-level security on the `credits` table and created a policy that allows authenticated users to read their credits.

### Step 3: Functions to manage credits

Next, we need to create functions to manage the credits. We'll call these functions `has_credits` and `consume_credits`.

```sql
create or replace function public.has_credits(account_id uuid, tokens integer)
  returns boolean
  set search_path = ''
  as $$
  begin
    return (select tokens >= tokens from public.credits where account_id = account_id);
  end;
  $$ language plpgsql;

grant execute on function public.has_credits to authenticated, service_role;
```

The `has_credits` function checks if the user has enough credits to perform an action. It takes the `account_id` and the number of tokens required as arguments and returns `true` if the user has enough credits, `false` otherwise.

```sql
create or replace function public.consume_credits(account_id uuid, tokens integer)
  returns void
  set search_path = ''
  as $$
  begin
    update public.credits set tokens = tokens - tokens where account_id = account_id;
  end;
  $$ language plpgsql;

grant execute on function public.has_credits to service_role;
```

You can now use these functions in your RLS policies, or in your application code to manage credits.

NB: we only allow authenticated users to read their credits. To update the credits, we use the service role key, since we lock down the `credits` table to only allow authenticated users to read their credits.

### Step 4: Using credits in your application

Now that you have set up the `plans` and `credits` tables, you can use them in your application to manage credits.

For example, when a user performs an action that consumes credits, you can call the `consume_credits` function to deduct the credits from the user's account. You can use the Supabase client to call the function from your application code.

NB: the `callOpenAIApi` is a placeholder for your API call to OpenAI. You should replace it with your actual API call.

NB: we assume this is in a route handler, so we use the `getSupabaseRouteHandlerClient` client. If you're in a server action, you should use the `getSupabaseServerClient` client. [Learn more about the Supabase clients here](supabase-clients).

```tsx
export function async consumeApi(accountId: string) {
  // Call the OpenAI API to get the usage
  const { usage, data } = await callOpenAIApi();

  const client = getSupabaseRouteHandlerClient({
    admin: true,
  });

  await client.rpc('consume_credits', {
    account_id: accountId,
    tokens: usage,
  });

  return data;
}
```

You can also use the function `has_credits` as part of your RLS policy to restrict access to certain resources based on the user's credits.

```sql
create policy tasks_write_policy
  on public.tasks
  for select
  using (
    (select auth.uid()) === account_id and
    public.has_credits((select auth.uid()), 1)
  );
```

### Step 5: Recharge credits

You can use webhooks from your billing provider to recharge credits when a user makes a payment. To do so, listen to events and update the `credits` table accordingly.

In the example below, we extend the webook handler to listen to the `onInvoicePaid` event and update the `credits` table with the new credits.

1. First, update the existing webhook handler to listen to the `onInvoicePaid` event.
2. Then, update the `credits` table with the new credits.

```tsx title="apps/web/app/api/billing/webhook.ts"
import { getBillingEventHandlerService } from '@kit/billing-gateway';
import { enhanceRouteHandler } from '@kit/next/routes';
import { getLogger } from '@kit/shared/logger';
import { getSupabaseServerAdminClient } from '@kit/supabase/server-admin-client';

import billingConfig from '~/config/billing.config';
import { Database } from '~/lib/database.types';

/**
 * @description Handle the webhooks from Stripe related to checkouts
 */
export const POST = enhanceRouteHandler(
  async ({ request }) => {
    const provider = billingConfig.provider;
    const logger = await getLogger();

    const ctx = {
      name: 'billing.webhook',
      provider,
    };

    logger.info(ctx, `Received billing webhook. Processing...`);

    const supabaseClientProvider = () =>
      getSupabaseServerAdminClient();

    const service = await getBillingEventHandlerService(
      supabaseClientProvider,
      provider,
      billingConfig,
    );

    try {
      await service.handleWebhookEvent(request, {
        onInvoicePaid: async (data) => {
          const accountId = data.target_account_id;
          const lineItems = data.line_items;

          // we only expect one line item in the invoice
          // if you add more than one, you need to handle that here
          // by finding the correct line item to get the variant ID
          const variantId = lineItems[0]?.variant_id;

          if (!variantId) {
            logger.error(
              {
                accountId,
              },
              'Variant ID not found in line items',
            );

            throw new Error('Variant ID not found in invoice');
          }

          await updateMessagesCountQuota({
            variantId,
            accountId,
          });
        },
      });

      logger.info(ctx, `Successfully processed billing webhook`);

      return new Response('OK', { status: 200 });
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error({ ...ctx, error }, `Failed to process billing webhook`);

      return new Response('Failed to process billing webhook', {
        status: 500,
      });
    }
  },
  {
    auth: false,
  },
);

async function updateMessagesCountQuota(params: {
  variantId: string;
  accountId: string;
}) {
  const client = getSupabaseRouteHandlerClient<Database>({ admin: true });

  // get the max messages for the price based on the price ID
  const plan = await client
    .from('plans')
    .select('tokens_quota')
    .eq('variant_id', params.variantId)
    .single();

  if (plan.error) {
    throw plan.error;
  }

  const { tokens_quota } = plan.data;

  // upsert the message count for the account
  // and set the period start and end dates (from the subscription)
  const response = await client
    .from('credits')
    .update({
      tokens_quota,
    })
    .eq('account_id', params.accountId);

  if (response.error) {
    throw response.error;
  }
}
```

We assume that we have a table named `plans` that stores the pricing information for each plan. We also assume that we have a table named `credits` that stores the credits consumed by each user.
The `credits` table has a column named `tokens_quota` that stores the number of credits available to the user.

In the `onInvoicePaid` event handler, we get the variant ID from the invoice line items and update the `credits` table with the new credits.
