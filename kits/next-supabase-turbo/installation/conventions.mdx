Below are some of the conventions used in the Next.js Supabase Turbo Starter Kit.

### Turborepo Packages

In this project, we use Turborepo packages to define reusable code that can be shared across multiple applications.

- **Apps** are used to define the main application, including routing, layout, and global styles.
- Apps pass down configuration to the packages, and the packages provide the corresponding logic and components.

### Creating Packages

**Should you create a package for your app code?**

- **Recommendation:** Do not create a package for your app code unless you plan to reuse it across multiple applications or are experienced in writing library code.
- If your application is not intended for reuse, keep all code in the app folder. This approach saves time and reduces complexity, both of which are beneficial for fast shipping.
- **Experienced developers:** If you have the experience, feel free to create packages as needed.

### Imports and Paths

When importing modules from packages or apps, use the following conventions:

- **From a package:** Use `@kit/package-name` (e.g., `@kit/ui`, `@kit/shared`, etc.).
- **From an app:** Use `~/` (e.g., `~/lib/components`, `~/config`, etc.).

### Non-Route Folders

Non-route folders within the `app` directory are prefixed with an underscore (e.g., `_components`, `_lib`, etc.).

- This prefix indicates that these folders are not routes but are used for shared components, utilities, etc.

### Server Code

Files located in `server` folders are intended for server-side code only. They should not be used in client-side code.

- This convention helps clarify where the code is meant to run, which is particularly important in Next.js where the distinction can be blurry.
- For example, server-related code for a part of the app can be found in the `_lib/server` folder.
