🚀 Welcome to your journey from Makerkit v1 to the Next.js SaaS Boilerplate! 

This guide is designed to help you understand the changes between the two versions and navigate your project migration to the new v2. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we've got you covered!

Here's a roadmap of the steps you'll take:

1. **Bootstrap a new project**: Kickstart a new project using the Next.js SaaS Boilerplate v2 🎉
2. **Update Schema**: Tweak the Postgres schema foreign key references, and integrate your existing tables 🧩
3. **Move files from older app**: Transport your files to the new app structure 📦
4. **Update imports to existing files**: Refresh imports to align with the new file structure 🔄
5. **Update configuration**: Modify the configuration files to match the new schemas ⚙️

## 1. Bootstrap a new project

The Next.js SaaS Boilerplate is a fresh take on Makerkit v1. You'll need to create a new project using this innovative boilerplate. Follow the [installation guide](clone-repository) to get your new project up and running in no time!

## 2. Update Schema

The schema in the Next.js SaaS Boilerplate has evolved significantly from Makerkit v1. You'll need to update your Postgres schema to match the new one.

Previously, you'd have a foreign key set to the organization ID:

```sql
organization_id bigint not null references organizations(id) on delete cascade,
```

Now, you'll have a foreign key set to the account ID as a UUID:

```sql
account_id uuid not null references public.accounts(id) on delete cascade,
```

In v2, an account can be both a user or an organization. So, instead of referencing the organization ID as in v1, you'll now reference the account ID. 

## 3. Move files from older app

In v2, you have the flexibility to add these files to either the "user scope" (`/home`) or the "account scope" (`/home/[account]`). Choose the one that best suits your project needs.

## 4. Update imports to existing files

You'll need to update the imports to your existing files to match the new file structure. This applies to all the components and utilities that you imported from Makerkit. For instance, a button previously imported from `~/core/ui/Button`, will now be imported from `@kit/ui/button`.

## 5. Update configuration

Lastly, you'll need to update the configuration files to match the new schemas. The configuration is now split across various files at `apps/web/config`. Pay special attention to the billing schema, which is now more versatile (and a bit more complex).
