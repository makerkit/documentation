This is an **advanced topic** - you should only follow these instructions if you are sure you want to add a new package to your Makerkit application instead of adding a folder to your application in `apps/web`. You don't need to do this to add a new page or component to your application.

To add a new package to your Makerkit application, you need to follow these steps.

First, enter the command below to create a new package in your Makerkit application:

```bash
turbo gen
```

Turborepo will ask you to enter the name of the package you want to create. Enter the name of the package you want to create and press enter.

If you don't want to add dependencies to your package, you can skip this step by pressing enter.

The command will have generated a new package under `packages` named `@kit/<package-name>`. If you named it `my-package`, the package will be named `@kit/my-package`.

## Exporting a module from a package

By default, the package exports a single module using the `index.ts` file. You can add more exports by creating new files in the package directory and exporting them from the `index.ts` file or creating export files in the package directory and adding them to the `exports` field in the `package.json` file.

### Exporting a module from index.ts

The easiest way to export a module from a package is to create a new file in the package directory and export it from the `index.ts` file.

```tsx
// packages/@kit/my-package/src/my-module.ts

export function myModule() {
  return 'Hello from my module';
}
```

Then, export the module from the `index.ts` file.

```tsx
// packages/@kit/my-package/src/index.ts
export * from './my-module';
```

### Exporting using the exports field in package.json

This can be very useful for tree-shaking. Assuming you have a file named `my-module.ts` in the package directory, you can export it by adding it to the `exports` field in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts",
    "./my-module": "./src/my-module.ts"
  }
}
```

When to do this?

1. when exporting two modules that don't share dependencies to ensure better tree-shaking. For example, if your exports contains both client and server modules.
2. for better organization of your package


For example, create two exports `client` and `server` in the package directory and add them to the `exports` field in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts",
    "./client": "./src/client.ts",
    "./server": "./src/server.ts"
  }
}
```

1. The `client` module can be imported using `import { client } from '@kit/my-package/client'`
2. The `server` module can be imported using `import { server } from '@kit/my-package/server'`

You can now use the package in your application by importing it using the package name.

```tsx
import { myModule } from '@kit/my-package';

console.log(myModule());
```

Et voilà! You have successfully added a new package to your Makerkit application. 🎉
