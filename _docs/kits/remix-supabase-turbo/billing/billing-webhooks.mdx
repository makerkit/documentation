Makerkit takes care of handling billing webhooks to update the Database based on the events received from Stripe.

Sometimes - you will need to set more webhooks, or do something custom with the webhooks.

In these cases, you can customize the billing webhook handler in Makerkit at `api/billing/webhooks/route.ts`.

By default, the webhook handler is set to `service.handleWebhookEvent(request)`:

```tsx
await service.handleWebhookEvent(request);
```

However, you can extend it using the callbacks provided by the `BillingService`:

```tsx
await service.handleWebhookEvent(request, {
  onInvoicePaid: async (data) => {},
  onPaymentFailed: async (sessionId) => {},
  onPaymentSucceeded: async (sessionId) => {},
  onCheckoutSessionCompleted: async (subscription, customerId) => {},
  onSubscriptionUpdated: async (subscription) => {},
  onSubscriptionDeleted: async (subscriptionId) => {},
});
```

You can provide one or more of the callbacks to handle the events you are interested in.

If the event is not in one of these methods, you can handle it in the `onEvent` method:

```tsx
await service.handleWebhookEvent(request, {
  async onEvent(event: string, data: unknown) {
    logger.info(
      {
        ...ctx,
        event,
        data,
      },
      `Received billing event`,
    );

    // Your custom code here
  }
});
```

However, you need to set the correct interface for the `data` parameter to handle the event correctly.

For example, to handle the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event, you can use the `onEvent` method:

```tsx
await service.handleWebhookEvent(request, {
  async onEvent(event: string, data: unknown) {
    if (event === 'invoice.payment_succeeded') {
      const invoice = data as Stripe.Invoice;
      // Your custom code here
    }
  }
});
```

You can find the list of events and their data in the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types).
